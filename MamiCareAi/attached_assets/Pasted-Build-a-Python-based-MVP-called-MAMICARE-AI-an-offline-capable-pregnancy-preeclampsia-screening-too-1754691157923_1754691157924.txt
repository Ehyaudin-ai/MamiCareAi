Build a Python-based MVP called MAMICARE AI: an offline-capable pregnancy preeclampsia screening tool for rural, low-infrastructure clinics.

Requirements:

Focus

Detect preeclampsia risk (Low / Moderate / High) using simple inputs.

Inputs (form fields)

1. Systolic BP (mmHg)

2. Diastolic BP (mmHg)

3. Urine protein level (negative/trace/1+/2+/3+)

4. Maternal age (years)

5. Gravida (number of pregnancies)

6. Parity (number of prior deliveries)

7. History of preeclampsia (yes/no)

8. Gestational age (weeks)

9. Symptoms (comma-separated: headache, vision problems, swelling, epigastric pain, decreased fetal movement)

AI model

1. Create or synthesize a small dataset if needed.

2. Train a lightweight classifier (logistic regression or decision tree) to predict risk category.

3. Save trained model as a local file (pickle or joblib).

4. Ensure the model can run offline on low-resource hardware.

Web app (Flask)

1. One page with a simple HTML form to enter the inputs.

2. One results page showing: • Predicted risk (Low/Moderate/High) • Short recommendation text (examples below) • If history of preeclampsia -> recommend low-dose aspirin in the recommendations

3. Button to save each case to a local CSV (timestamped).

Recommendations logic (example)

High risk: “High risk — urgent referral needed coupled with loading magnesium sulfate (MgSo4). Call or transfer to nearest facility.”

Moderate risk: “Moderate risk — contact health worker and schedule assessment within 24 hours.”

Low risk: “Low risk — continue routine care and next appointment on [date].”

If history_of_preeclampsia == yes: append “Recommend low-dose aspirin per protocol; confirm with clinician.”

Extras & constraints

Minimal dependencies: Flask, pandas, scikit-learn, joblib (or pickle), optionally numpy.

Provide a script train.py that creates/generates dataset, trains model, and saves model file.

Provide app.py (Flask), model.py (helper inference), templates/ (form.html, result.html).

Keep UI extremely simple, mobile-friendly, and text-first (no heavy JS).

Include a sample mock dataset (CSV) and example saved results CSV.

Deliverables & README

Provide README with local run steps: • pip install -r requirements.txt • python train.py # generates dataset and saves model • python app.py # runs Flask app on localhost

Comment code thoroughly for fast hackathon handover.

Keep project lightweight and demo-ready (no cloud).

Finish by generating all files with working code so I can run the app immediately in Replit.
